LaTeX Documentation Notes 

The relevant files are a good tutorial for anyone who wants to get started with LaTeX and wants to improve themselves in scientific notation. However, the slide package was not uploaded in the notes. Instead, it contains a sample motivation letter and summary text that you can send academically.

Relevant notes were prepared by Yasin Tosun from Siegen University between September 2022 and March 2023 for the course contents of the ECONMATIC brand, which is within the scope of the internal training program of the Gen√ß Ekonomistler Club.

For the use of relevant notes and full version notes, you are kindly requested to contact the course instructors.

Thanks!
